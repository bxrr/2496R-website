                        VEX EDR robotics. He’s helped with a lot of the building of the robot and came up with solutions
                        to many of the problems we’ve come upon when testing the robot. For example, when our intakes
                        were drooping and touching the ground, Brandon designed a hard-stop to elevate the intakes.
