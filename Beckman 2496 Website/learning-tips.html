                <h1>1. Know The Basics</h1>
                <div class="txtContainer">
                    <p><span class="tab"></span> Familiarize yourself and recognize all the VEX parts. Knowing the name of vex parts makes it easier to look up questions on the internet and ask other people for help. A good way to do this is to go onto Vex's official v5 product shop at <a class="shoplink" href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/v5/products/view-all?" target="blank">vexrobotics.com</a> and go through the list of all EDR products and read the descriptions. Also, make sure to read the <a class="shoplink" href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/vrc-change-up/VRC-Game-Manual-10012020.pdf" target="blank">VEX game manual</a> so you recognize all field elements.

                <h1>2. Communicate Clearly</h1>
                <div class="txtContainer">
                    <p><span class="tab"></span>Communication is essential to get better at both robotics and have a good team dynamic. Communication includes asking others for help and making team decisions. Not communicating well leads to confusion, misunderstanding, and often people getting left out and not contributing to the team because they don't know what's happening. Make sure everyone understands a certain design choice or concept before moving onto the next topic.

                </div>
                <h1>3. Don't Jump Straight to Building</h1>
                <div class="txtContainer">
                    <p><span class="tab"></span> Any experienced student in robotics will tell you that it is better to spend time brainstorming, researching, and designing before  building something. Brainstorming is a way to let everyone contribute and researching lets you discover ideas that you have potentially missed out on. Designing a part before building lets all the team members give feedback by pointing out potential flaws and help build. By jumping straight into building, you will definitely end up building a part by yourself that has multiple imperfections and will likely need to rebuild the same part multiple times. In the end, you will have saved no time by rushing to the build process and will likely worsen the team dynamic.

                <h1>4. Be More Open Minded to New Ideas</h1>
                <div class="txtContainer">
                    <p><span class="tab"></span> The teams that succeed in robotics have the most creative design solutions to certian problems. Try not to shoot down certain ideas and see if its possible to incorperate them into your design.
